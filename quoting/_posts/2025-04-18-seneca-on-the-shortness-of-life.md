> Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future.
>
> **The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortuneâ€™s control, and abandoning what lies in yours.**
>
> What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.
