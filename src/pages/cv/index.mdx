  ## Professional statement

  **I've worked in various capacities as both a front & backend developer for
  the last 10 years. Most recently my responsibilities have been centred around
  _engineering management_ – but for my next role I'd like to pivot back towards
  an _individual contributor_ position within a team.**

  The common thread throughout my career has been _the application technical
  solutions to user/business problems,_ and this informs the work that I do
  – I'm passionate about the user experience, and understanding the problem (or
  job-to-be-done).
  
  I love working on the web platform in general, and with small diverse teams of
  solution–focused, open–minded individuals.

  ## Employment History (Professional, Consulting & Academic)

  ### Professional experience

  - **Founder** • 2018—present • _Malalta [^2]_

    I started my development agency, Malalta, in 2018. At this point in time
    _strategy_ and _management_ work had started to feel abstract and I wanted
    to be working closer to the customer. Today I work with a diverse team of 5
    contractors, but remain the primary developer.

    The work we do is focused around: web development, eCommerce (Shopify
    in particular), and business process automation. The technologies I'll
    working with most weeks include:

    - **Infrastructure:** _serverless_ (ie. AWS Lambda, AWS CDK, AWS EventBridge,
      AWS DynamoDB, GitHub Actions, and various REST/GraphQL API integrations
      between services usually via webhooks).
    - **Backend languages:** _Python_ or _TypeScript_ in our serverless
      functions.
    - **Frontend frameworks:** _React_ (usually _NextJS_), _Astro_ for
      building static sites, and _Shopify's platform_ which is built around a
      _GraphQL_ API and _Liquid_-based theming engine. 

    Examples of the type of work we regularly do include:

    1. [Achievement bullets...]

  - **Director of Strategy** • 2018 • _Alphacrucis University College [^3]_

    In this role I was responsible for coordinating the annual strategic
    planning process in partnership with the CEO. I did very little _software
    development_ related work during this year, but am happy to talk about it
    in more detail if it's of interest.

  - **Chief Information Officer** • 2010—2017 • _Alphacrucis University College_

    While my main responsibilities were strategic direction, engagement with
    C level stakeholders, and managing a team of 12 IT professionals,
    Alphacrucis was small enough that I continued to play a large hands–on role
    in the development cycle.
    
    Some _development_ related achievements that I implemented or took the lead
    on during this time include:
    
    1. Implemented a CI/CD pipeline for website & Learning Management System
       deployments to production, utilising GitHub Actions and AWS.
    2. Championed various code-quality initiatives, such as a migration to
       TypeScript, adoption of Python type hints, GitHub pull request work flow,
       automated testing, 
    3. Wrote several internal tools in Python and TypeScript to automate large
       amounts of data-entry work, utilising REST, GraphQL and browser automation.
    4. Wrote numerous integrations between various platforms, utilising AWS
       Lambda, PostgreSQL & Microsoft SQL Server databases, Microsoft 365 APIs,
       Salesforce APIs, Stripe APIs, Google DataStudio (now Looker Studio),
       PowerBI, cron jobs, shell scripting, etc.

  - **Web Application Developer** • 2007—2010 • _Alphacrucis University College_

    In this role I became the organisation's first permanent web developer. I
    was responsible for improving the online student experience by writing new
    applications, improving existing ones, and bringing some previously
    outsourced work in house.

    1. Migrated several PHP/jQuery websites to Django/React.
    2. Implemented several website redesigns.
    3. Wrote several student facing apps in collaboration with academics to
       improve the online learning experience.
