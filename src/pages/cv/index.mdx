  ## Professional statement

  **While my most recent responsibilities have centred around engineering
  management, for my next role I'd like to pivot back to being an _individual
  contributor_ within a team.**

  Throughout my career an anchoring "north star" has been _"the application of
  technical solutions to business & user problems",_ and this continues to
  inform the work that I do â€“ I'm passionate about the user experience, and
  understanding the problem to be solved or customer's job-to-be-done.

  ## Employment history (professional, consulting & academic)

  ### Professional experience

  - **Founder** â€¢ 2018â€”present â€¢ _Malalta [^2]_

    I started Malalta â€“ a software development agency â€“ in 2018. At this stage in my
    career strategy & management work had started to feel too abstract and I
    wanted to be working closer to the end user again.
    
    Today I am the primary developer working with a diverse, distributed team of
    5 developers/designers. The work we do is focused around web development,
    eCommerce (Shopify in particular), and business process automation.
    
    Broadly, the technologies I work with most weeks include:

    - **Infrastructure:** _serverless technologies_ (eg. AWS Lambda, AWS CDK,
      AWS EventBridge, AWS DynamoDB, GitHub Actions, and various REST/GraphQL
      API integrations between services, usually via webhooks).
    - **Backend languages:** _Python_ or _TypeScript_ within our serverless
      functions.
    - **Frontend frameworks:** _React_ (usually _NextJS_), _Astro_ for
      building static sites, and _Shopify's platform_ which is built around a
      _GraphQL_ API and _Liquid_-based templating engine. We also have a few
      _Django_ sites we maintain.
    
    I occasionally work on _Wordpress_ sites as part of the volunteer work
    we do at Malalta for a few non-profits, but I'm not a specialist.

    Beyond writing code my work at Malalta involves:
    
    - Reviewing and providing feedback on pull requests
    - Collaborating with remote teammates throughout the development process
    - Discussing design requirements with non-technical clients
    - Designing and configuring technical solutions inline with the client
      budgets
    - A lot of time management

  - **Director of Strategy** â€¢ 2018 â€¢ _Alphacrucis University College [^3]_

    In this role I was responsible for coordinating the annual strategic
    planning process in partnership with the CEO. I didn't do much software
    development work this year, but am happy to talk about this role in more
    detail if it's of interest.

  - **Chief Information Officer** â€¢ 2010â€”2017 â€¢ _Alphacrucis University College_

    My main responsibilities were strategic direction, engagement with
    C-level stakeholders, and managing a team of 12 individuals. However,
    Alphacrucis as an organisation was small enough that I continued to play a
    large handsâ€“on role in the development cycle.
    
    _Development related_ achievements I implemented or took the lead
    on during this period include:
    
    1. _Implementing a CI/CD pipeline for deploying various websites to
       production._ Tools: GitHub Workflows, AWS Lambda, AWS CDK.
    3. _Writing several internal business tools in TypeScript and Python to
       automate large amounts of data-entry work._ Tools: TypeScript & Python,
       REST & GraphQL APIs, and browser automation.
    4. _Writing numerous integrations between internal platforms._ Tools: AWS
       Lambda, PostgreSQL & Microsoft SQL Server databases, Microsoft 365 APIs,
       Salesforce APIs, Stripe APIs, Google DataStudio (now Looker Studio),
       PowerBI, cron jobs, shell scripting, etc.
    2. _Championing various code-quality initiatives_, including: migrating to
       TypeScript, migrating from class based React components to functional
       React Hooks, adoption of Python type hints, implementing a GitHub pull
       request driven work flow, and automated testing in CI/CD.

  - **Web Application Developer** â€¢ 2007â€”2010 â€¢ _Alphacrucis University College_

    In this role I became the organisation's first permanent web developer. I
    was responsible for improving the online student experience by creating new
    websites and applications for students and staff, improving existing ones,
    and bringing some previously outsourced work in house. During this time I:

    1. Migrated several idiosyncratic PHP/jQuery websites to Django and vanilla
       JavaScript.
    2. Implemented two website redesigns in collaboration with an external
       design agency.
    3. Wrote several student facing apps in collaboration with academics to
       improve the online learning experience for students.
  
  - **Self employed musician & freelance web developer** â€¢ 1996â€”2007

    Whilst at University and for a few years after I worked primarily as a
    guitarist with various recording artists and TV shows. Towards the end of
    this period I started building simple websites for people I worked with.
  
  ### Consulting experience

  - **Virtual CTO** â€¢ 2022 â€¢Â _Alphacrucis University College_

    After the unexpected departure of the previous CIO I was asked to provide
    technical leadership and mentorship to the IT team for a period of 12
    months. This was a 2 day per week role.
  
  - **Virtual CTO** â€¢ 2020â€”2021 â€¢Â _Virtual Creative_

    In this role I provided technical leadership to the _Virtual Creative_ team
    as they set up their new digital learning business.
  
  - **Advisor** â€¢ 2020 â€¢Â _Atelier_

    In this role I provided advice to _Atelier_ as they shifted to an online
    first, fashion rental business model.
  
  - **Advisor** â€¢ 2019â€”2022 â€¢Â _Pwrmeals_

    In this role I provided advice and support to a small team of developers as
    they built a new online meal delivery business.

  ### Academic experience

  - **Lecturer in Business Information Systems** â€¢ 2021â€”2022 â€¢Â _Alphacrucis
    University College_

    In this role I taught the _Business Information Systems_ unit to Bachelors
    and Masters students. The unit content was tailored for entrepreneurship,
    and centred around databases, SaaS products, and the software development
    process.
  
  - **Tutor: Music Theory / Aural / Guitar** â€¢ 2002â€”2004 â€¢Â _Australian
    Institute of Music_

    Towards the end of my degree at the _Australian Institute of Music_ I taught
    the first year music theory and aural skills classes. I also taught guitar
    to individual students interested in majoring in performance as part of
    their degree.
